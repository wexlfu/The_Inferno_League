# The Inferno League
Version 0.2.2

The Abhailah Guardians move to crush an outbreak of drake and saurian raids, but soon discover a much bigger threat in the Inferno League. They must attempt to stop these worshippers of elemental fire before the ultimate flame descends upon the lands of the dunefolk.

Though the campaign features only one difficulty level, there is opportunity for extra challenge in completing some alternative objectives or actions. These will award you with medals of recognition at the end of the campaign. Can you earn them all?
