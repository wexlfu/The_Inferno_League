The Abhailah Guardians move to crush an outbreak of drake and saurian raids, but soon discover a much bigger threat in the Inferno League. They must attempt to stop this fiery menace before the ultimate flame descends upon the lands of the dunefolk.

Though this campaign features a single difficulty level, there is opportunity for extra challenge in completing some alternative objectives or actions. These will award you with medals of recognition at the end of the campaign.
