# The Inferno League
* 626 YW

# Factions
## Abhailah Emirate
* "Guardians of the North"
* Northernmost Emirate, guardians against the bitter swamp, elves, and drakes.

## Razhaikib Emirate
* Known in Abhailah as the "Cleanfeet", as they avoid conflict and do not often ally with others and thus do not march in the dust to war.

## The Inferno League
* The Bitter Alliance (Saurians + Trolls)
  * They steal magic items, raid coffers, ambush caravans, and perform general mercenary work.
  * They receive the support of Adebelus against Wesnoth, Thar-Nella, and rival saurians.
  * They seek revenge against Thar-Nella for defeating them 58 years earlier.
* Kalagra's Legion (Drakes)
  * They are keenly interested in their draconic heritage, and see the Inferno League as a way to expand their territory and prestige.
* Ignicia's Flaming Convent (Magi)
  * Dedicated to the ultimate study of fire, they seek to spread flames across the world.
* Adebelus 19 (Undead)
  * Noting that drakefire can warm him ever so slightly, he seeks a true dragon to grant him real warmth against his eternal chill.

# Summary
The Abhailah Guardians move to crush an outbreak in drake and saurian raids, but soon discover a much bigger threat in the Inferno League. They must move to stop these worshippers of elemental fire before the ultimate flame descends upon the lands of the dunefolk.
