# Factions
## Abhailah Emirate
* "Guardians of the North"
* Northernmost Emirate, guardians against the bitter swamp, elves, and drakes.

## Razhaikib Emirate
* Known in Abhailah as the "Cleanfeet", as they avoid conflict and do not often ally with others and thus do not march in the dust to war.
* They are known for their heavy calvary.

## The Inferno League
* The Bitter Alliance (Saurians + Trolls)
  * They steal magic items, raid coffers, ambush caravans, and perform general mercenary work.
  * They receive the support of Adebelus against Wesnoth, Thar-Nella, and rival saurians.
  * They seek revenge against Thar-Nella for defeating them 58 years earlier.
* Kalagra's Legion (Drakes)
  * They are keenly interested in their draconic heritage, and see the Inferno League as a way to expand their territory and prestige.
* Ignicia's Flaming Convent (Magi)
  * Dedicated to the ultimate study of fire, they seek to spread flames across the world.
* Adebelus 19 (Undead)
  * Noting that drakefire can warm him ever so slightly, he seeks a true dragon to grant him real warmth against his eternal chill.

# Storyline
## The Initial Assault
Saurian mercenaries begin raiding dunefolk lands. Mal-Ravanal has made Wesnoth poorer pickings. Drakes also carry out raids on northern towns.
Due to the raids, the Abhailah Emirate sends some of its military to the northern front (Abhailah faces hostile Emirates to the south, so cannot spare more).
Muba's division, sent to a border post on the very north-west, must fend off a large saurian raid. Muba decides on a retalitory strike, dealing a heavy blow to the Bitter Alliance.
On the eastern side, the division sent attempts a strike north toward the drakes but are defeated and must retreat all their forces back to the border to fortify it. They request aid from Muba, and together they hold back the drakes. More are on the way, however, and Muba is sent to get help from the Razhaikib Emirate.

## Gaining Allies
The "no man's land" between the emirates is overrun with Adebelus' undead. Muba liberates some villages on his way to Razhaikib.
Upon reaching Razhaikib, they agree to provide help if they deal with an orc problem on their border. Muda does so, but Razhaikib only provides a few heavy calvary and some healers. A knight who has been training with the Razhaikib agrees to come along as well.
With no options left, they travel north to try to get help from the elves. They must fight through a mountain pass.
Upon arriving in the forest, they find the elves cold to their request. The Empathists, however, provide some earth magi (recruitable), a loyal shadow mage commander hailing from Thar-Nella, and indicate that they will send more help in the future.

## Fighting Back
Muba's divison encounters undead and saurian resistance on their way back to the Abhailah border. There they find that the Razhaikib have accepted/capitulated to the Inferno League and their bribes and are now advancing on the eastern border. Muba heads that way and forces them to surrender and hand over more healers.
They then advance up through the eastern plains (orc country) to avoid detection by the Inferno League.
After leaving the plains and approaching the Inferno League's capital, they must send a falcon westward to alert the Empathists to cover their attack on the capital.
They storm the capital and enter the lava cavern where Ignacia and Adebelus attempt to turn drakes into dragons through the power of fire and magic. They defeat the Inferno League and return home, having subjugated the drakes.
